# samseg
Brain White Matter Lesion segmentation pipeline using SAMSEG

## Requirements

**This pipeline required FreeSurfer to already be installed on the user's computer**. Another version of this pipeline uses FreeSurfer in a docker and can be found to this link: [samseg-docker](https://github.com/BMAT-Apps/samseg-docker). This pipeline provides the possibility to perform an automatic segmentation of white matter lesions using SAMSEG from FreeSurfer ([SAMSEG](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Samseg)).

## Utilization
